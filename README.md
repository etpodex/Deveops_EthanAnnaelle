To make the application compatible with environments like Docker Compose or Kubernetes, the first step is to create a Docker image of the application. This is achieved by defining a Dockerfile, which specifies the steps for building the image.

It's important to exclude unnecessary files and folders, that are not required in the image. To handle this, a .dockerignore file is used to specify which files and directories should be excluded during the build process.

Before proceeding with the instructions, ensure that Docker is installed and running on your system.
